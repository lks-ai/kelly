# Kelly: A Live Music Assistant over WhatsApp

The biggest problem for finding events for me is that there is so much advertising in between me and searching/browsing and ticket companies like gigantic have search but it is hard to use for planning. The standard search method assumes i am looking for an artist or tour, i cant search by date or region or genre, or other, more fuzzy terms.

## The Solution

We decided to build a chat agent over WhatsApp which acts as an assistant who can engage event-goers and link them directly to tickets for events they could be looking for. Not ony that, but we also provide music entertainment, link to live music videos for artsists and genres, and generally interact with the user in a conversational manner that can be flexible but stay on topic. Users are invited to interact in natural ways using natural language. It is also 100% multilingual.
